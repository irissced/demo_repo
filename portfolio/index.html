        <p class="intro">
          I am Iriss Ced, a second-year university student enrolled at Whitecliffe College, specializing in Design and Digital Media. Originally hailing from the Philippines, my family and I made the transition to New Zealand six years ago. I possess a deep-rooted passion for the artistic realm, aspiring to establish a distinguished career as a designer following the culmination of my studies and graduation from university.        </p>

          Upon completion of my degree, my objective is to acquire and enhance my design and digital skills, enabling me to forge a successful path as a designer. My ultimate ambition is to embark on global travels while collaborating with prominent organizations. Additionally, I aspire to contribute to the behind-the-scenes processes involved in film production, with the long-term aspiration of securing opportunities within renowned production companies.
